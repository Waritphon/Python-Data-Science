While there are a few types of credit scores used in the United States, the FICO score is the best known and most widely used.\n","\n","When a borrower applies for a loan, Lending Club gets the borrowers credit score from FICO - they are given a lower and upper limit of the range that the borrowers score belongs to, and they store those values as fico_range_low, fico_range_high. After that, any updates to the borrowers score are recorded as last_fico_range_low, and last_fico_range_high.\n","\n","A key part of any data science project is to do everything you can to understand the data. While researching this data set, I found a project done in 2014 by a group of students from Stanford University on this same dataset.\n","\n","In the report for the project, the group listed the current credit score (last_fico_range) among late fees and recovery fees as fields they mistakenly added to the features but state that they later learned these columns all leak information into the future.\n","\n","However, following this group's project, another group from Stanford worked on this same Lending Club dataset. They used the FICO score columns, dropping only last_fico_range_low, in their modeling. This second group's report described last_fico_range_high as the one of the more important features in predicting accurate results.\n","\n","The question we must answer is, do the FICO credit scores information into the future? Recall a column is considered leaking information when especially it won't be available at the time we use our model - in this case when we use our model on future loans.\n","\n","This blog examines in-depth the FICO scores for lending club loans, and notes that while looking at the trend of the FICO scores is a great predictor of whether a loan will default, that because FICO scores continue to be updated by the Lending Club after a loan is funded, a defaulting loan can lower the borrowers score, or in other words, will leak data.\n","\n","Therefore we can safely use fico_range_low and fico_range_high, but not last_fico_range_low, and last_fico_range_high. Lets take a look at the values in these columns:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"adAuwm5m3sp9","outputId":"ee7aa90f-ab66-48f9-a641-973907350d58","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":158},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582008538366,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":5623,"user":{"displayName":"Teerapong

Preparing the Features for Machine Learning\n","In this section, we'll prepare the filtered_loans_2007.csv data for machine learning. We'll focus on handling missing values, converting categorical columns to numeric columns and removing any other extraneous columns.\n","\n","We need to handle missing values and categorical features before feeding the data into a machine learning algorithm, because the mathematics underlying most machine learning models assumes that the data is numerical and contains no missing values. To reinforce this requirement, scikit-learn will return an error if you try to train a model using data that contain missing values or non-numeric values when working with models like linear regression and logistic regression.\n","\n","Here's an outline of what we'll be doing in this stage:\n","\n","Handle Missing Values\n","Investigate Categorical Columns\n","Convert Categorical Columns To Numeric Features\n","Map Ordinal Values To Integers\n","Encode Nominal Values As Dummy Variables\n","First though, let's load in the data from last section's final output:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"qzxA2SWi3sq1","outputId":"02bb8226-f44f-4a31-99eb-ca4ee0d3806a","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":402},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1582008541952,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":8934,"user":{"displayName":"Teerapong Panboonyuen","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA4fMVOZRNe7AoPpHiIzjBMAn8BwtXgqm-ArIavMQ=s64","userId":"10952242531985089596"}}},"source":["filtered_loans = pd.read_csv('filtered_loans_2007.csv')\n","print(filtered_loans.shape)\n","filtered_loans.head()"],"execution_count":33,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(39239, 24)\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>loan_amnt</th>\n","      <th>term</th>\n","      <th>installment</th>\n","      <th>grade</th>\n","      <th>emp_length</th>\n","      <th>home_ownership</th>\n","      <th>annual_inc</th>\n","      <th>verification_status</th>\n","      <th>loan_status</th>\n","      <th>purpose</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>addr_state</th>\n","      <th>dti</th>\n","      <th>delinq_2yrs</th>\n","      <th>earliest_cr_line</th>\n","      <th>inq_last_6mths</th>\n","      <th>open_acc</th>\n","      <th>pub_rec</th>\n","      <th>revol_bal</th>\n","      <th>revol_util</th>\n","      <th>total_acc</th>\n","      <th>last_credit_pull_d</th>\n","      <th>pub_rec_bankruptcies</th>\n","      <th>fico_average</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>5000.0</td>\n","      <td>36 months</td>\n","      <td>162.87</td>\n","      <td>B</td>\n","      <td>10+ years</td>\n","      <td>RENT</td>\n","      <td>24000.0</td>\n","      <td>Verified</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>credit_card</td>\n","      <td>Computer</td>\n","      <td>AZ</td>\n","      <td>27.65</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>Jan-1985</td>\n","      <td>1.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>13648.0</td>\n","      <td>0.837</td>\n","      <td>9.0</td>\n","      <td>Sep-2016</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>737.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2500.0</td>\n","      <td>60 months</td>\n","      <td>59.83</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","      <td>&lt;
